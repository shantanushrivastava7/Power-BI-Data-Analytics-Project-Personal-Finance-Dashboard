💰 Personal Finance Dashboard – Power BI
🔍 Project Overview
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to track and analyze monthly income, expenses, savings, and investments. The goal was to gain clear visibility into personal financial health, identify overspending patterns, and support better budgeting decisions.

📈 Key Insights & Findings
Overspending in Non-Essential Categories

Entertainment and dining consistently exceeded the allocated monthly budget, accounting for 22–28% of total expenses in certain months.

Inconsistent Savings Pattern

Savings dipped significantly during months with high discretionary spending, indicating a need for better control in variable expense categories.

High Monthly Fixed Costs

Rent, EMIs, and utilities made up nearly 50% of total monthly expenses, leaving limited flexibility for saving or investing.

Investment Tracking

Investments into SIPs and mutual funds were regular but accounted for only 12% of income — an opportunity to increase investment for long-term goals.

Best Saving Month Identified

April had the highest savings rate (35%) due to bonus income and reduced discretionary spending — providing a benchmark for future months.
